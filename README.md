# Personalized Feed Project

## Project Overview

The Personalized Feed Project is designed to create a personalized content feed for users, allowing them to discover content aligned with their interests. This feed is dynamic and constantly updated to provide the best possible user experience.

## Task Description

Your role in this project involves backend development and implementing key features:

### Backend Development

1. Develop a backend server using Node.js to handle user requests and serve relevant content.
2. Implement a MongoDB database to store user data, interests, and the content to be displayed in the feed.
3. Design efficient algorithms and data structures to retrieve and display content based on user interests.
4. Implement APIs for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data and content.

## Requirements

To contribute to this project, you should have the following skills and knowledge:

- Proficiency in Node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL.
- Strong understanding of RESTful API design and implementation.
- Knowledge of user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Problem-solving skills and the ability to optimize performance for large datasets.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `server.js`: The main server file that handles server setup and API routing.
- `routes/userRoutes.js`: User-related API routes and controllers.
- `routes/contentRoutes.js`: Content-related API routes and controllers.
- `controllers/userController.js`: Controllers for user-related operations.
- `controllers/contentController.js`: Controllers for content-related operations.
- `services/userService.js`: User-related business logic and database operations.
- `services/contentService.js`: Content-related business logic and database operations.
- `models/user.js`: User data model.
- `models/content.js`: Content data model.
- `middleware/authentication.js`: Authentication middleware for user authorization.
- `schemas/userSchemas.js`: Validation schemas for user data.
- `schemas/contentSchema.js`: Validation schemas for content data.

## Getting Started


To get started with the Personalized Feed Project on your local development environment, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the project repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<https://github.com/priyankarajputttt/personalized-feed-node.git>` with the actual URL of your project's Git repository.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd personalized-feed-node
   ```

   Next, install the project dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager). Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will download and install all the required packages and modules specified in the `package.json` file.

3. **Configure MongoDB**

   The project relies on MongoDB as its database. You'll need to set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection URL in the project.

   - If you don't have MongoDB installed locally, you can install it by following the instructions on the [MongoDB website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

   - Once MongoDB is installed, you can create a new database and obtain the connection URL.

   - Update the MongoDB connection URL in the `server.js` file in your project directory. Look for the following line and replace it with your database URL:

     ```javascript
     mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/your-database-name', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
     ```

     Replace `'mongodb://localhost/your-database-name'` with your actual MongoDB connection URL.

4. **Start the Server**

   After configuring the database, you can start the server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the Node.js server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running on a specific port (e.g., `Server is running on port 3000`).

5. **Testing the API**

   Your server should now be up and running. You can use Postman or any other API testing tool to interact with the API endpoints provided by the project.

   - **User Registration**:
     - Use a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/api/users/register` to register a new user.

   - **User Login**:
     - Use a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/api/users/login` to log in as an existing user.

   - **Content Feed**:
     - Use a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/content/feed` to retrieve a personalized content feed based on user interests.



These steps should help you set up and run the Personalized Feed Project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
